According to company representatives, brand awareness has grown steadily for three to four years, but not as fast as we would like.</p>

                        <p>While working on the idea, the campaign developers are focused on the insight that is based on the Yota product - the operator does not impose on the user. No tariffs - everyone chooses services independently, depending on their standard needs. Therefore, the brand and the agencies decided not to hide from users that they are facing Yota ads.</p>

                            Friends Moscow (the marketing agency) put forward a hypothesis - if you do not shout to the user in the face about the product, then in contrast he will remember the brand, because there are much-standardized advertising around, constantly offering to buy something.</p>
